# Just one of my another stupid project about Extracting text from images 🤓

#### LOL I just feel like I am obsessed with it. 😐 Seems like all I do is text extraction

## OK first I will explain how to set it up 😋

# Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/psychoSherlock/react-textractor.git
cd react-textractor
npm install
```

> Go to [Imgur](https://api.imgur.com/) and create an account, select anonymous upload option and get the key
> Go to [This Api](https://rapidapi.com/nadkabbani/api/ocrly-image-to-text/) and subscribe to it
> Create a directory called `config` inside `src`
> Add a file, called `API.js` inside it and add the following lines

```js
export const rapidApiKey = RAPIAPI_OCRLY_KEY;
export const imgurKey = IMGUR_API_KEY;
```

> Run

```bash
npm start
```

### Done 😊

#### This was just a learning project. I was just learning react and I thought of building it and also learn new concepts about react like axios api and state management.

#### Of course there are many ways to improve this and I didn't care about the UI that much, feel free to fork it at your free time 🤓
